Cycloid Menu Schema.

Overall Structure

The menu system is designed to control a 4-wheel stepper motor system using an LCD and a rotary encoder. It allows users to adjust various parameters, including wheel speeds, LFO settings, and speed ratios. The system is navigated using a rotary encoder for scrolling and short/long presses for selection and mode changes.
Key Components
    * Rotary Encoder: The primary input device.
    * Turning the encoder scrolls through options or adjusts values.
    * A short press selects an option or toggles editing.
    * A long press returns to the main menu or pauses/resumes the system.
    * LCD (16x2 Display): Displays the menu structure, options, and parameter values.
    * Menu Options: The main menu consists of the following options:
    * SPEED: Adjusts the individual speeds of the four wheels (X, Y, Z, A).
    * LFO: Configures Low-Frequency Oscillator settings for the wheels.
    * RATIO: Selects predefined speed ratios for the wheels.
    * MASTER: Adjusts the master speed control.

Menu Navigation
1. Main Menu: 
  Upon startup, the user is presented with the main menu, 
  displaying the four options (SPEED, LFO, RATIO, MASTER). 
  The encoder is used to scroll through these options, and 
  a short press selects the highlighted option. A long press 
  pauses or resumes the system.
2. SPEED Menu:
    * Displays the speed of the currently selected wheel.
    * Turning the encoder selects between the four wheels (X, Y, Z, A).
    * A short press toggles between selecting a wheel and editing its speed.
    * When editing, turning the encoder changes the selected wheel's speed.
    * A long press returns to the main menu.
3. LFO Menu:
    * Allows configuration of LFO parameters.
    * The encoder scrolls through the LFO parameters for each wheel (X Depth, X Rate, Y Depth, Y Rate, Z Depth, Z Rate, A Depth, A Rate).
    * A short press toggles between selecting an LFO parameter and editing its value.
    * When editing, turning the encoder adjusts the selected parameter.
    * A long press returns to the main menu.
4. RATIO Menu:
    * Provides predefined speed ratios for the wheels.
    * The encoder scrolls through the available ratio sets.
    * A short press takes the user to an "APPLY" confirmation screen.
    * The user can choose "Y" (Yes) or "N" (No) using the encoder.
    * Selecting "Y" applies the ratios to the wheel speeds and returns to the main menu.
    * Selecting "N" returns to the ratio selection screen.
    * A long press returns to the main menu.
5. MASTER Menu:
  * Allows adjustment of a master speed multiplier. 
  * A short press allows the user to toggle the ability at alter the master speed multiplier.
  * Turning the encoder changes the master speed. 
  * A long press returns to the main menu.

System Pause/Resume
  * A long press on the encoder in the main menu toggles the system's pause state.
  * When paused, an asterisk is displayed on the LCD. The motors should not move when paused.
  * Another long press resumes the system.

- Pi Zero 2 W serial control
- Web interface for Zero 2 W interfaced to serial control
    Flask/Django web server
    WebSocket for real-time updates
    SD card for storing presets/configurations
    Touch display using PyGame or Kivy
- Consider commoning of grounds between Pi Zero and Arduino. Ensure only 1 ground connection is commoned to avoid ground loops / circulating currents.
- SD card on Pi for saving and recalling machine states
- LCD screen maybe?
- Free up processes on arduino for pure motor control, handle all input via Pi

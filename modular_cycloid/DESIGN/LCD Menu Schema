Cycloid Menu Schema.

Overall Structure

The menu system is designed to control a 4-wheel stepper motor system using an LCD and a rotary encoder. It allows users to adjust various parameters, including wheel speeds, LFO settings, and speed ratios. The system is navigated using a rotary encoder for scrolling and short/long presses for selection and mode changes.

Key Components
   * Rotary Encoder: The primary input device.
   * Turning the encoder scrolls through options or adjusts values.
   * A short press selects an option or toggles editing.
   * A long press returns to the main menu or pauses/resumes the system.
   * LCD (16x2 Display): Displays the menu structure, options, and parameter values.
   * Menu Options: The main menu consists of the following options:
   * SPEED: Adjusts the individual speeds of the four wheels (X, Y, Z, A).
   * LFO: Configures Low-Frequency Oscillator settings for the wheels.
   * RATIO: Selects predefined speed ratios for the wheels.
   * MASTER: Adjusts the master speed control.
   * RST: Allows the user to reset the machine to default settings.

Menu Navigation
1. Main Menu: 
  Upon startup, the user is presented with the main menu, 
  displaying the four options (SPEED, LFO, RATIO, MASTER). 
  The encoder is used to scroll through these options, and 
  a short press selects the highlighted option.
2. SPEED Menu:
   * Displays the speed of the currently selected wheel.
   * Turning the encoder selects between the four wheels (X, Y, Z, A).
   * A short press toggles between selecting a wheel and editing its speed.
   * When editing, turning the encoder changes the selected wheel's speed in increments of 0.1.
   * Wheel speed is always displayed at a 4 digit number with 1 decimal place and a range of 000.0 to 256.0 inclusive. 
   * The default value on boot should be 010.00 for all wheels.
   * A long press returns to the main menu.
3. LFO Menu:
   * Allows configuration of LFO parameters.
   * The encoder scrolls through the LFO parameters for each wheel (X Depth, X Rate, X Uni/Bi, Y Depth, Y Rate, Y Uni/Bi, Z Depth, Z Rate, Z Uni/Bi, A Depth, A Rate). A Uni/Bi)
   * Depth is always 4 digits with 1 decimal place and is limited to the values between 000.0 and 100.0 inclusive. 
   * The default Depth value for all wheels upon booting is 000.0.
   * Rate is a 4 digit number with 1 decimal place and is limited to the values between 000.0 and 256.0.
   * The default Rate value for all wheels upon booting is 000.0.
   * Uni/Bi selects between uni- and bipolar transformations. Rotating the encoder to change the value should toggle between UNI and BI.
   * A short press toggles between selecting an LFO parameter and editing its value.
   * When editing, turning the encoder adjusts the selected parameter by 0.1.
   * A long press returns to the main menu.
4. RATIO Menu:
   * Provides predefined speed ratios for the wheels.
   * The encoder scrolls through the available ratio sets.
   * A long press takes the user to an "APPLY" confirmation screen.
   * The user can choose "Y" (Yes) or "N" (No) using the encoder.
   * Selecting "Y" with a long press applies the ratios to the wheel speeds and returns to the main menu.
   * Selecting "N" with a long press returns to the ratio selection screen.
5. MASTER Menu:
   * Allows adjustment of a master speed multiplier. 
   * A short press allows the user to toggle the ability at alter the master speed multiplier.
   * Turning the encoder changes the master speed. 
   * Master speed is always a 5 digit number with a range of 000.01 to 999.99
   * The default value for master speed upon boot is 001.00
   * A long press returns to the main menu.
6. RESET Menu:
   * The user can choose "Y" (Yes) or "N" (No) using the encoder.
   * Selecting "Y" with a long press resets all values to the default boot values.
   * Selecting "N" with a long press returns to the main menu.

System Pause/Resume
  * A long press on the encoder in the main menu toggles the system's pause state.
  * When paused *PAUSED* is displayed on the LCD. The motors should not move when paused.
  * Another long press resumes the system.

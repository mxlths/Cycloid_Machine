Software/Hardware upgrades
    - Pi Zero 2 W serial control
    - Web interface for Zero 2 W interfaced to serial control
        Flask/Django web server
        WebSocket for real-time updates
        SD card for storing presets/configurations
        Touch display using PyGame or Kivy
    - Consider commoning of grounds between Pi Zero and Arduino. Ensure only 1 ground connection is commoned to avoid ground loops / circulating currents.
    - SD card on Pi for saving and recalling machine states
    - LCD screen maybe?
    - Free up processes on arduino for pure motor control, handle all input via Pi
    - Consider adding DIL switches for microstepping control. Might not be required once tuning complete.
    - Set current on stepper drivers / get new 128 microstep silent drivers




Transmission upgrades
    - 2 x UCF204 pillow block bearings with 20mm ground stainless rod connecting them, 60T GT2 pulley mounted to shaft
    - Might required re-design to accomodate height of bearings
